# Service Observability & Incident Management Platform

This project demonstrates how backend systems detect, evaluate, and respond
to service incidents using controlled fault injection and lightweight
observability, without relying on external monitoring tools.

## Key Concepts
- Backend-first system design
- Controlled fault injection (chaos testing)
- Golden Signal evaluation (latency, traffic, errors)
- Automated incident detection and resolution

## Architecture (High Level)
- Target Service (simulated workload & failures)
- Metrics Collector
- Incident Evaluator
- Incident Management Service

This is an independent, self-initiated project focused on real-world backend
engineering practices.
